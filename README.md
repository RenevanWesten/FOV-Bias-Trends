These directories contain Python (v3) scripts for plotting/analysing model output.

Python scripts can be found in the directory 'Program'.
Model output can be found in the directory 'Data'.

The processed model output are stored as NETCDF files and using the relevant scripts one can regenerate all the figures.
We provided a small selection of the original model output (native grid) and is only converted to yearly-averaged data (due to storage limitations). 
Some scripts (e.g., FOV_index.py and AMOC_transport.py) use the original model output, but note that the original data is incomplete to create the entire time series. We recommend to use the processed model output or download the publically-available model output and run the relevant scripts.
